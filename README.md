# RadixSort
This is a C++ Program to Sort the Given Data using Radix sort.

Problem Description
1. In this algorithm sorting of data is done from least significant digit to most significant digit.
2. Here we need 10 different spaces labeled 0 to 9.
3. Assume we have ‘n’ number of inputs.
4. Let ‘d’ be the maximum number of digit the input data has.
5. The time complexity for radix sort is O(n*d).
6. Radix sort solves the problem of card sorting by sorting on the least significant digit first.

Problem Solution
1. Get the maximum value from the input array which has ‘d’ digits.
2. Starting from least significant digit, sort the data.
3. Take this data as input for next significant digit.
4. Run the iteration till d digit.
5. Display the result.
6. Exit.
